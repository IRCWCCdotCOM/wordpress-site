When first shown the Magnificent Obsession™, many people think of innovative ways to improve what we do. In the interests of time savings, here are some of the most common:
<ul>
	<li><strong>What sort of weapons can I use? </strong>Any weapon at all, as long as it is a CO2 powered cannon firing BBs at 150 PSI or less.</li>
	<li><strong>Can I use mines and torpedoes?</strong> No, those aren't BBs.</li>
	<li><strong>Can I ram?</strong> Sure! We do it all the time! However, you will be penalized points for doing it and it annoys people when you damage their ships that way.</li>
	<li><strong>Can I build a carrier and launch RC aircraft?</strong> Can you <strong>build</strong> R/C 1:144 aircraft? Lemme know! That sounds cool! However, you can't use them as weapons. They aren't BBs.</li>
</ul>
