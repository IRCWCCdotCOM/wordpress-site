<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">In the 1970’s a small group of hobbyists who were familiar with constructing and operating radio controlled model boats and airplanes began experimenting with the concept of building model warships which could actually engage each other in combat. The challenge was to build reusable models with systems capable of inflicting controlled amounts of hull damage on an opponent’s ship, and eventually sinking the model. yes" These individuals, now known as the “founders” of the hobby of model warship combat, were the first to place small gas operated BB-firing cannons on semi-scale model R/C warships. Spread over five states and working over the telephone and through the mail, this group shared their experiences and refined the first cannons, gas systems and pumps that were needed to make functional warship models a reality Perhaps more significantly, however, these individuals began creating and refining the rules that were needed to provide uniformity in both the construction and the battling of these new models so that the hobby could be enjoyed by others safely and expand.

<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">Since those early years a continual process of incremental development has resulted in the reliable, cost effective and safe BB cannons and gas and radio systems which are used today throughout the hobby. Remarkably, the current Rules of the IRCWCC follow very closely the originals in intent, and of the changes that have been made, most have been introduced to account for newly developed technologies. Along the way, eco-friendly compressed CO2 was mandated to replace Freon as the gas propellant. Starting in 1991 all newly constructed models had to be built to 1/144 scale. Single-shot cannons were developed, and then mandated, to fire one BB at a time from a magazine of 50 or 75. The offensive and defensive power of each ship’s guns and pumps was allocated based on an analysis of the historic combat power of the prototypes. To help eliminate disputes over historic ship dimensions and speeds, a comprehensive `ship list' fixing the scale speed and size for models was established.

<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">Throughout the 1980’s and ‘90’s, membership in the IRCWCC increased up and down the east coast, in the mid-west, on the west coast and in Canada.  In 2004 the IRCWCC was incorporated as a non-stock membership corporation. Along the way, the IRCWCC has given birth to other semi-scale model warship combat clubs. There are now similar clubs that utilize gas-propelled 1/4 inch ball bearings as projectiles; clubs that build ships in the larger 1/96 and 1/72 scales to facilitate the modeling of smaller vessels such as destroyers and PT boats; and other variants. But for us, the original is still the best: the IRCWCC!

<div align="center"><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;"><b>The purposes of the International R/C Warship Combat Club, Inc. (IRCWCC) are: </b>
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">1. To provide interested persons with the opportunity to associate with others interested in the hobby of radio controlled semi-scale model warship combat;
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">2. To promote safety, good sportsmanship and fun in semi-scale model warship combat competitions;
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">3. To make information available to members and others concerning the history of early 20th Century warships, and the construction and operation of semi-scale models of those ships in simulated combat activities.
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">To accomplish its purposes the IRCWCC does the following:
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">It offers membership to any interested person who is willing to abide by the Bylaws and Rules of the Club.
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">It maintains a web site which provides access to information on the construction and operation of scale model warships equipped for R/C combat.
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">It maintains and publishes guidelines for the uniform construction and operation of model warships which serve as Rules for its members and anyone wishing to construct a model warship in accordance with IRCWCC Rules.
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">It sanctions events in which the participants agree to conduct R/C model warship combat in accordance with IRCWCC Rules.
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">It organizes and sponsors at least one week-long “international” Annual Championship event open to all members.
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">It encourages the formation of local groups interested in pursuing the construction and operation of scale model warships equipped for R/C combat in accordance with IRCWCC Rules.
</span></div>
<div><span class="size12 Helvetica12" style="color: #000000;">Many model warship events are conducted at the local level. Although it is possible to join only the IRCWCC, most members also join with others in local groups so they can battle more frequently. Local groups can also provide opportunities for “rookies” to learn from veterans the variety of skills needed to successfully build and battle a model warship. Some local groups host building parties where novices can get hands-on training and one-on-one help with specific construction problems. Local groups also provide an informal opportunity to meet with others interested in the hobby.</span></div>
